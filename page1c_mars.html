                Today, it has a very low atmospheric pressure-- less than 1% of Earth's-- with no hope of holding liquid water.
                Its atmosphere is made of mostly carbon dioxide, yet its greenhouse effect is very weak. It does not have an ozone layer

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>Orbital Evidence

                    <li>
                        <em>Mariner9</em> and <em>Viking</em> orbiters have captured features that look like dry riverbeds.

                        The mineral composition of the surface shows three general types of hydrated minerals, which are formed in the presence
                        of liquid water (Clay minerals, hydrated sulfates, and hydrated silica (opal)).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Some regions of Mars appear to have formed billions of years after its thick, ancient clay deposits,
                        suggesting that Mars remained wet for an extended period.
                    </li>

                <li>Rover Mineral Evidence
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hematite spheres have been found, which form in water on Earth.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        Evidence has been found that suggests the Gale Crater once held an ancient lake.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                It is important to note that these were not small amounts of water on ancient Mars. Evidence suggests that there may
                have been floods that emerged from underground-- enough to cover the entire surface to a depth of around 130 meters.
                There is a link between temporary heating events and flooding on Mars, in which ice would have melted and flooded the planet.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                So, how could Mars have possibly lost all of this water? The answer lies in Mars' thin atmosphere, small planet size,
                and its magnetic field.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Mars would have had an incredible amount of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere in the past. In fact, its volcanoes could
                have outgassed enough to make its atmosphere 400 times as dense as it is today. However, most of this gas has been lost to
                space. The reason for this has to do with its magnetic field.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                To explain magnetic fields simply, they require three things:
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>
                    Moderately rapid rotation
                </li>
                <li>
                    An interior region of electrically conducting fluid (i.e. Molten metal)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Convection in the interior
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The result of this is a shield that protects the planet's atmosphere from solar wind. Without it, atmospheres can be
                stripped away and lost to space.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                In Mars' case, it most likely had convecting molten metal in its core early in its history. As time went on,
                the planet cooled and convection ceased, which weakened its magnetic field. Water molecules in its atmosphere were
                broken down by ultraviolet light from the sun, which allowed individual hydrogen atoms to be lost to space. Water molecules
                couldn't be made whole again. Carbon dioxide was lost much in the same way.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Chemical analysis shows that Mars' era of lakes ended around 3 billion years ago. Some flooding may have occurred later,
                but ultimately, its climate became the way it is today. It still has water ice underground and in polar caps, and it may
                even have pockets of liquid water.

            <p class="awayText">
                As far as life goes on Mars, it would have been habitable during its wet periods more than 3 billion years ago.
                Today, its only chance lies in some subsurface areas.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                We have detected methane gas that suggests either a biological or geological source, but neither has been confirmed.
                If the source is geological, it could suggest enough internal heat to harbor life.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                A controversial topic that relates to life on Mars today is sending humans to Mars. This would, of course, be an
                incredible achievement for humankind and could allow us to make discoveries without the limitations of rovers.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                However, it is important to acknowledge that without having an absolute answer about life on Mars, sending humans there
                could give us a false positive. It is easy to disinfect rovers and spacecraft before they leave Earth; it is much harder
                (likely impossible) to stop humans from spreading bacteria or microscopic life on Mars. It would be hard to prove that any
                life found while or after humans landed on Mars actually originated from the planet itself.
