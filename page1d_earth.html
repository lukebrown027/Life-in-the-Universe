                Earth is the third planet in our solar system and has what can be considered the ideal conditions for life.
                We aren't sure exactly when life first arose, but fossil evidence shows life already existed 3.6 billion years ago.
                It can be argued that life may have began around 3.85 billion years ago, but it has yet to be proven.

            <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Early life would have most likely been species of bacteria and archaea. We can prove this through genetic comparisons,
                which show us which modern organisms are evolutionarily the oldest.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Life requires a source of energy, and for the first life on Earth, this would have been some sort of chemical energy.
                Environments like warm ponds, volcanic hot springs, or deep-sea vents could have provided a great source of energy.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                We will never be able to prove exactly how life began, but we have theories. Some of these theories have been proven to
                be possible, but it can't be confirmed whether those processes were the ones to create life or not
                (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Miller-Urey-experiment" target="_blank">The Miller-Urey Experiment</a>).

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Organic molecules, either chemically produced or brought from space due to an impact (unlikely), were found in oceans
                where clay and other minerals were common. Clay is a material that could have helped catalyze the building of RNA strands,
                which, in turn, became enclosed in "pre-cells". 
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The "RNA World" theory argues that early life would have used RNA instead of DNA. RNA is one strand, which would
                require less energy than DNA, which has two. 
            </p>

            <p class="awayText">
                So, to put it all together:
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>
                    Through a combination of atmospheric chemistry, deep-sea vents, and molecules brought to Earth from space or
                    formed in impacts, earth Earth had a great amount of organic molecules.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    More complex molecules, including RNA, grew from building blocks like clay minerals. Minerals also helped the production
                    of pre-cells, in which RNA and other organic chemicals became enclosed.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    RNA molecules within pre-cells facilitated reactions that led to self-replicating RNA. Molecular natural selection
                    favored faster and more accurate replication.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Natural selection and mutations in RNA in pre-cells led to an increase in complexity until some structures became
                    true living organisms!
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    DNA evolved from RNA, natural selection passed this onto organisms, and more complex life could evolve.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                It is important to note that early life would have been anaerobic, meaning it did not require oxygen. The first organisms
                were most likely chemoautotrophs; multiple stages of evolution would have been required to use photosynthesis. 
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                In fact, many species of microbes most likely went extinct once photosynthesis began being used, because the rise in oxygen
                would have killed them. The surviving species either evolved or survived by staying underground, and these still exist today.

            <h2 class="awaySubTitle">Formation and the Hadean Eon</h2>

            <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Earth may have been habitable within 100 million years after its formation. We have no way of knowing whether
                microscopic life existed during this time or not, but if it did, it could have very well gone through near or total
                extinction events multiple times. 
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                A huge reason for this was the Heavy Bombardment period. This period encompasses the first few hundred million years
                after our solar system was formed, during which the "tail end" of the formation of planets created most of the craters
                that are found on ancient planetary surfaces.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Jovian planets did not form far away from the Sun; they formed near it and migrated outwards. This would have cause a
                spike in impacts by disturbing the orbits of asteroids and comets.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Earth had more impacts than the Moon (in fact, there is a theory that the Moon was created from an impact so violent that a
                chunk of the Earth was torn off). Earth was a larger target and had a stronger gravitational pull than the Moon.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            
            <p class="awayText">
                The eon in which the Heavy Bombardment period exists is called the Hadean eon. This eon lasted over 600 million years,
                so even though large impacts were considered "frequent", they were often separated by thousands or even millions of years.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                There is evidence that oceans and continents existed around 4.5 billion years ago, and, combined with the spaced out impacts,
                life could have existed during the Hadean eon.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                However, the largest impacts could have completely vaporized the oceans. In some cases, global surface temperatures could
                have been raised high enough to melt the upper crust. Impacts like this are considered "sterilizing impacts", as any life
                that may have existed on Earth would have most likely been wiped out.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Fortunately for us, our solar system has grown much more stable with time. As discussed <a href="page1b_jupiter.html#jupiters-pull" target="_blank">here</a>, Jupiter and its
                gravitational pull played an important part in allowing Earth to become as habitable as it is today. Jupiter-sized
                planets are rare in most solar systems.
