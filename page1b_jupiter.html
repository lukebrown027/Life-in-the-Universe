            <p class="awayText" id="jupiters-pull">
                Jupiter is the fifth planet in our solar system. It is a gas giant, composed largely of helium and hydrogen.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The formation of Jupiter was incredibly important to the development of life on Earth. When our solar system was young,
                asteroids were a common danger to developing planets. Large planets like Jupiter formed much closer to the Sun, and, over time,
                migrated outwards. This migration, combined with Jupiter's strong gravitational pull, cleared the solar system of a great amount
                of planetary debris. This gave Earth a fighting chance to develop life.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            
            <p class="awayText">
                Recent studies have shown that our solar system is special. Our star is a yellow dwarf, which is uncommon in our observable
                universe. The most common star, by far, is the red dwarf. Unfortunately, the red dwarf very rarely hosts planets as large as
                Jupiter. Because of this, its planets are subjected to intense and frequent impacts.

        <!-- Europa Title and Description -->
        <div class="scroll1">

            <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Europa is a great candidate for simple life in our solar system. There is strong evidence for liquid water under its thick crust,
                and there are several sources of energy that could potentially sustain microscopic life.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The water that is likely sitting under Europa's surface may be twice the amount we have on Earth. There are several factors that
                would allow water to exist in liquid form on a moon so far from the Sun.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>Tidal Flexing
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Jupiter's strong gravity slightly stretches Europa while it orbits. This is unnoticeable to the naked eye, of course, but it creates
                        enough heat to help keep the planet's subsurface water in liquid form.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>

                <br/>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Scientists are not sure exactly how thick Europa's icy crust is, but it is certainly enough to insulate the liquid water underneath.
                        The crust is expected to be at least several kilometers thick, and is therefore able to protect any subsurface water from the harsh environment
                        above. It is also believed that water occasionally gushes up to the surface and "repaves" the ice.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                While Europa could potentially have plenty of liquid water, there is another requirement for life that it struggles to meet: energy.
                On Earth, our life gets plenty of energy from the Sun. This energy can then be transferred to other organisms in a cycle. Europa, however,
                is roughly 392 million miles farther from the Sun than Earth. Its surface is uninhabitable for several reasons, one of which being intense
                radiation. This means that an energy source must exist under the surface for life on Europa to exist.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Hydrothermal vents are the most likely source of energy for any potential life on Europa. The same process exists in Earth's oceans.
                The difference is that while this is just one of several energy sources on Earth, it is likely the main source of energy on Europa, and
                therefore very weak. We certainly cannot expect any multicellular life in Europa's oceans.
