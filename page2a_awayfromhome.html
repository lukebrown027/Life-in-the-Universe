            <p class="awayText">
                When attempting to find life outside of Earth, we have to understand the "building blocks" of life. Life on Earth
                uses 25 out of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements. Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen make up 96% of
                the mass of living organisms. Luckily for our search, this requirement is easily met in our observable universe.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                While it is easy to find these elements in the universe, they also need to be in the form of molecules that can be used
                for life. Many other worlds have environments with intense radiation, which can destroy organic molecules. There are also
                situations where they may be intact beneath the surface, but are unable to react with each other unless a liquid or gas is
                available to move them.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Another factor to consider is an energy source. It is very unlikely that we would find life that uses photosynthesis,
                because the energy available in sunlight decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun. If photosynthetic life were
                farther from the Sun, it would have to either be much larger, much more efficient, or have a much slower metabolism. Reactions
                that provide energy must be ongoing, and require an atmosphere or a liquid medium.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The next step is water or a liquid medium. Water plays three vital roles for life on Earth:
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>
                    Dissolves organic molecules, making them available for chemical reactions within cells.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Transports chemicals in and out of cells.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Is directly involved in many metabolic reactions in cells.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                There are other liquids that life could use instead of water, but water has clear advantages.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>
                    It remains liquid over a wide range of temperatures. The top of its range is significantly higher than other liquids.
                    Also, life using colder liquids would have a slower metabolism than on Earth.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Frozen water is less dense than liquid water. This helps with survival during winter, since a floating layer of
                    ice helps insulate the water beneath it. This also may be important to long-term climate stability.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Electrical charge is distributed differently in water. There is a charge separation in electrons that affects how
                    water dissolves other substances. For example: salt dissolves easily in water, but oil does not dissolve at all.
                    The most important part of this is that living cells' membranes do not dissolve in water, but tend to come apart
                    in other liquid candidates such as liquid ethane, methane, methanol, and ammonia.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                So, while liquids other than water can technically be used by life, it could be much harder to find life that is suited for that.

                Stars are a huge part of finding other habitable planets. Not every star has planets orbiting it, and for those that do,
                an even fewer part of those are capable of hosting habitable planets.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Stars shine by fusing hydrogen into helium. Four hydrogen nuclei turn into one helium nuclei. As the fusion process goes
                on, there is less pressure to keep the star from collapsing on itself, so the core shrinks and the temperature increases.
                The increase in temperature only increases the rate of fusion, and the cycle continues.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The more massive a star is, the more vigorously fusion happens in the core. A star's mass can range from 8% of the mass of our
                Sun to 150 times the mass of our Sun. Anything greater than that could cause the star to blow itself apart.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Spectral types are what we use to classify stars from hottest to coolest. The order is OBAFGKM. Our Sun is classified as a
                "G" star; 90% of stars are lower in mass than our Sun.

                Criteria that makes a star a good "Sun":

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>
                    The star and, therefore, the gas cloud it formed from, should contain enough elements besides hydrogen and helium
                    to allow for the formation of habitable planets.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    The star should last long enough for life to be able to form and evolve.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    For surface life at least, the star should shine with steady light and should have a habitable zone.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    The star or star system should allow the planets around it to have stable, nearly circular orbits.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Star types "O" and "B" can be ruled out as habitable stars, and "A" and "F" are possible but unlikely. We are mostly
                interested in looking at "G", "K", and "M" types.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                There are issues, of course, with many of these stars. There is the problem of intense radiation, which keeps planets
                sterile unless it does not penetrate far into the ground, oceans, or ice. Planets can also develop a protective ozone
                layer if their atmosphere is thick or if it contains enough oxygen.
            </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                Another issue is that with low-mass "M" type stars, their habitability zone is so close to the star that it can lock planets
                into synchronous rotation. This means that the same side of the planet would be facing the star at all times.

                There are three major differences between our solar system's planets and extrasolar planets:
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <ol class="awayText">
                <li>
                    Many known extrasolar planets orbit their stars closer than Mercury orbits the Sun. Almost none of them are located as
                    far as our Jovian planets are.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Many planets with orbits close to their star are Jupiter-like in mass, making them "hot Jupiters". 
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    Many planets have large orbital eccentricities, meaning they have more of an elliptical and stretched out path.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                In our observable universe, though, there are many Earth-sized planets, and many of these are in their star's habitable
                zone. It is even estimated that 1 in 5 star systems may have one or more habitable planets.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                The fact that life arose so quickly on Earth suggests that the origin of life was fairly "easy". However, life existed for
                around 4 billion years before humans evolved, suggesting that producing a civilization is much more difficult. 
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                With humans appearing so late in time on Earth, it can be said that a long period of evolution must precede technological
                intelligence. Even with this evolutionary pressure, the Cambrian Explosion (led to diversity) and the K-T Impact
                (impact event that killed the dinosaurs and led to the evolution of primates) seem to be completely chance events.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>

            <p class="awayText">
                In any case, simple arguments suggest that with all of the time that has passed since the Big Bang (13.8 billion years),
                there should be evidence of other civilizations out there. The Fermi Paradox, posed by Enrico Fermi, asks a great question...
                "So where is everybody?"
